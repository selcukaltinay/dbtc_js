            <h3>Arrays are Not Constants</h3>
            <p>
            <br>
            The keyword const is a little misleading.
            <br>
            It does NOT define a constant array. It defines a constant reference to an array.
            <br>
            Because of this, we can still change the elements of a constant array.

            Elements Can be Reassigned
            <br>
            You can change the elements of a constant array
